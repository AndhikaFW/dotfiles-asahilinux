Ini terutama berguna jika anda harus sering mengetikkan sebuah kata (misalnya, 'tak ditandatangi').  Setiap penekanan tombol di input dipisahkan oleh sebuah tanda titik dua ':' . Perlu dicatat bahwa penekanan tombol secara literal berarti penekanan tombol, sehingga anda harus menulis apa yang akan anda tekan di keyboard. Pada tabel di bawah, kolom di kiri menampilkan input dan kolom kanan menampilkan apa yang akan diketik.\n\n"enter" (misalnya baris baru)                Enter atau Return\na (misalnya a kecil)                          A\nA (misalnya a besar)                       Shift+A\n: (titik dua)                                  Shift+;\n' '  (spasi)                              Spasi

Comment=Baca komentar di aksi "Ketik 'Hello'" dahulu.\n\nQt Designer menggunakan Ctrl+F4 untuk menutup jendela.  Tetapi di KDE, Ctrl+F4 adalah pintasan untuk menuju ke desktop virtual 4, jadi pintasan ini tidak bekerja di QT Designer.  Lebih lanjut lagi, Qt Designer tidak menggunakan standar KDE Ctrl+W untuk menutup jendela.\n\nMasalah ini dapat dipecahkan dengan memetakan ulang Ctrl+W menjadi Ctrl+F4 ketika jendela yang aktif adalah Qt Designer. Ketika Qt Designer aktif, setiap kali Ctrl+W ditekan, Ctrl+F4 akan dikirim ke Qt Designer. Pada aplikasi lain, efek Ctrl+W tetap tidak berubah.\n\nSekarang kita perlu menentukan tiga hal: Sebuah pemicu jalan pintas baru di 'Ctrl+W', sebuah aksi input keyboard baru yang mengirim Ctrl+F4, dan sebuah kondisi baru bahwa jendela yang aktif adalah Qt Designer.\nQt Designer biasanya selalu memiliki judul 'Qt Designer by Trolltech', jadi kondisi akan memeriksa jendela aktif yang memiliki judul seperti itu.

Comment=Baca komentar di aksi "Ketik 'Halo'" dahulu.\n\nSeperti pada aksi "Ketik 'Halo'", aksi ini mensimulasikan input keyboard, terutama, setelah menekan Ctrl+Alt+B, aksi mengirim B ke XMMS (B di XMMS melompat ke lagu selanjutnya). Kotak cek 'Kirim ke jendela tertentu' diperiksa dan sebuah jendela dengan kelasnya yang berisi 'XMMS_Player' ditentukan; ini akan membuat input selalu dikirim ke jendela ini. Dengan demikian, anda dapat mengendalikan XMMS bahkan jika, misalnya, XMMS berada di desktop virtual yang berbeda.\n\n(Jalankan 'xprop' dan klik di jendela XMMS lalu cari WM_CLASS untuk melihat 'XMMS_Player').

Comment=Konqueror di KDE3.1 memiliki tab, dan sekarang anda juga dapat memiliki gestur.\n\\ukup tekan tombol tengah mouse dan mulai menggambar salah satu gestur, dan setelah anda selesai, lepaskan tombol mouse. Jika anda hanya butuh menempelkan pilihan, juga masih akan bekerja, cukup klik tombol tengah mouse. (Anda dapat mengubah tombol mouse untuk menggunakan pengaturan global).\n\\aat ini, terdapat gestur berikut yang tersedia:\npindah kanan dan kiri belakang - Maju (Alt+Right)\npindah kiri dan kanan belakang - Mundur (Alt+Left)\npindah ke atas dan kembali ke bawah - Atas (Alt+Up)\nberputar lawan arah jarum jam - Muat Ulang (F5)\n\\entuk gestur dapat dimasukkan dengan melakukan gestur di dialog konfigurasi. Anda dapat juga melihat di pad numerik anda untuk membantu anda: gestur dikenali seperti ruang petak 3x3, bernomor 1 sampai 9.\n\nPerlu dicatat bahwa anda harus melakukan gestur dengan tepat untuk memicu aksi. Karena hal ini, maka dimungkinkan untuk memasukkan gestur lainnya bagi aksi. Anda harus mencoba untuk menghindari gestur yang rumit ketika anda mengubah arah gestur mouse lebih dari sekali.  Misalnya, 45654 atau 74123 mudah untuk dilakukan, tapi 1236987 mungkin sudah cukup sulit.\n\nKondisi untuk semua gestru didefinisikan di grup ini. Semua gestur ini hanya aktif jika jendela yang aktif adalah Konqueror (kelas berisi 'konqueror').
